  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This tap's Fizzy package tracks a pinned snapshot of upstream `master`, not the
      latest upstream GitHub release.

      The formula name is unique (`fizzy-cli-master`), but the installed executable is
      still `fizzy` so existing wrappers can keep working.

      Homebrew prevents silent collisions with any future upstream `fizzy` formula by
      treating them as conflicting packages.
